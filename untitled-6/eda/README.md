Python libraries represent missing numbers as nan which is short for "not a number". You can detect which cells have missing values, and then count how many there are in each column with the command:

```python
print(data.isnull().sum())
```



## Number of unique values in each column

```python
unique_counts = pd.DataFrame.from_records([(col, df[col].nunique()) for col in df.columns],
                          columns=['Column_Name', 'Num_Unique']).sort_values(by=['Num_Unique'])
```

> Some common practices:
>
> * Inspect the distribution of target variable. Depending on what scoring metric is used, **an** [**imbalanced**](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5128907) **distribution of target variable might harm the model‚Äôs performance**.
> * For **numerical variables**, use **box plot** and **scatter plot** to inspect their distributions and check for outliers.
> * For classification tasks, plot the data with points colored according to their labels. This can help with feature engineering.
> * Make pairwise distribution plots and examine their correlations.
