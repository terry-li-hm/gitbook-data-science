> When referring to probability, there are 2 major schools of thought: classical, or frequentist, probability interpretation views probabilities in terms of the frequencies of random events. In somewhat of a contrast, the Bayesian view of probability aims to quantify uncertainty, and updates a given probability as additional evidence is available. If these probabilities are extended to truth values, and are assigned to hypotheses, we then have "learning" to varying degrees of certainty.
