A tricked found by Jeremy to avoid overfitting is to train a network with small images for few epochs and then train it using larger images. It is only applicable to architectures that can take arbitrary image sizes and thus not applicable to VGG.

If a smaller batch size is used, the gradient is calculated using less number of images so it is less accurate as it is more volatile. You can try to re-run the learning rate finder to see if the best learning rate changed but it shouldn't make a huge difference as the learning rate differ exponentially. \(per Jeremy\)
