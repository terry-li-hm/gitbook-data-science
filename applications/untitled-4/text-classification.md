# Text Classification

## Text classification

Text classification is a core problem to many applications, like spam detection, sentiment analysis or smart replies. In this tutorial, we describe how to build a text classifier with the fastText tool.

### What is text classification?

The goal of text classification is to assign documents \(such as emails, posts, text messages, product reviews, etc...\) to one or multiple categories. Such categories can be review scores, spam v.s. non-spam, or the language in which the document was typed. Nowadays, the dominant approach to build such classifiers is machine learning, that is learning classification rules from examples. In order to build such classifiers, we need labeled data, which consists of documents and their corresponding categories \(or tags, or labels\).

As an example, we build a classifier which automatically classifies stackexchange questions about cooking into one of several possible tags, such as `pot`, `bowl` or `baking`.
