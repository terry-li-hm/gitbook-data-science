[DeepMind AI reduces energy used for cooling Google data centers by 40%](https://www.blog.google/topics/environment/deepmind-ai-reduces-energy-used-for/)

> Since our objective was to improve data center energy efficiency, we trained the neural networks on the average future PUE \(Power Usage Effectiveness\), which is defined as the ratio of the total building energy usage to the IT energy usage.
