* [Partial Dependence Plots \| Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/partial-dependence-plots) It is a bit unclear what the function parameters "features" and "feature\_names" mean. After some trial-and-error I figured that with "feature\_names" you select the features or variables from your dataset that you wanna build you partial dependence on and "features" just selects those variable;es from "feature\_names" that you wanna actually plot.
