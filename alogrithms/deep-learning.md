#### What to do with overfitting per fast.ai

1. Add more data
2. Use data augmentation
3. Use architectures that generalize well
4. Add regularization
5. Reduce architecture complexity

#### Examples of what can be tried to improve the model \(From Machine Learning Yearning\)

> * Get more data: Collect more pictures of cats.
> * Collect a more diverse training set. For example, pictures of cats in unusual positions; cats   with unusual coloration; pictures shot with a variety of camera settings; ….
> * Train the algorithm longer, by running more gradient descent iterations.
> * Try a bigger neural network, with more layers/hidden units/parameters.
> * Try a smaller neural network.
> * Try adding regularization \(such as L2 regularization\).
> * Change the neural network architecture \(activation function, number of hidden units, etc.\)

> If you choose well among these possible directions, you’ll build the leading cat picture platform, and lead your company to success. If you choose poorly, you might waste months.
