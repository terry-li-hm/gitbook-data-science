# Deep Learning in General

* [Zayd's Blog – Why is machine learning 'hard'?](http://ai.stanford.edu/~zayd/why-is-machine-learning-hard.html?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTkRJeE0yTmpNak5sWVdRdyIsInQiOiJVVjI1S2RvcUFPRDcxcU9tN0xYZnU3NzhCT3M1XC9CRkdDb0VKbENFV2tqeWowWFVWTUNCd29GV0IwcVNqaDFnN2ErOVVLSHI0eHlEZlhGTHN1SnpiUUI5djJHajBDeUVWMGVIakZUZ1o4MEZjeHZhc1dXZ3lXV2NKVVkxZ2l4aDMifQ)

Neural nets really like standardized variables. \(per Jeremy\)

Softmax likes picking one class. So it is ridiculous to use it for multi-label classification \(per Jeremy\)

If a smaller batch size is used, the gradient is calculated using less number of images so it is less accurate as it is more volatile. You can try to re-run the learning rate finder to see if the best learning rate changed but it shouldn't make a huge difference as the learning rate differ exponentially. \(per Jeremy\)

Neural nets really like standardized variables. \(per Jeremy\)



#### Examples of what can be tried to improve the model \(From Machine Learning Yearning\)

> * Get more data: Collect more pictures of cats.
> * Collect a more diverse training set. For example, pictures of cats in unusual positions; cats   with unusual coloration; pictures shot with a variety of camera settings; ….
> * Train the algorithm longer, by running more gradient descent iterations.
> * Try a bigger neural network, with more layers/hidden units/parameters.
> * Try a smaller neural network.
> * Try adding regularization \(such as L2 regularization\).
> * Change the neural network architecture \(activation function, number of hidden units, etc.\)

> If you choose well among these possible directions, you’ll build the leading cat picture platform, and lead your company to success. If you choose poorly, you might waste months.



Softmax likes picking one class. So it is ridiculous to use it for multi-label classification. \(per Jeremy\)

Batch Normalization helps your network learn faster by “smoothing” the values at various stages in the stack. Exactly why this works is seemingly not well-understood yet, but it has the effect of helping your network converge much faster, meaning it achieves higher accuracy with less training, or higher accuracy after the same amount of training, often dramatically so.

* If the learning rate is too large \(0.01\), the cost may oscillate up and down. It may even diverge \(refer to the graph above\).
* A lower cost doesn't mean a better model. You have to check if there is possibly overfitting. It happens when the training accuracy is a lot higher than the test accuracy.
* In deep learning, we usually recommend that you:
* Choose the learning rate that better minimizes the cost function.
* If your model overfits, use other techniques to reduce overfitting.
* Complexity of machine learning comes from the data rather than from the lines of code.
* Intuitions from one domain or from one application area often do not transfer to other application areas.
* Applied deep learning is a very iterative process where you just have to go around this cycle many times to hopefully find a good choice of network for your application.

## Initialization

* Random initialization is used to break symmetry and make sure different hidden units can learn different things.
  * The weights ​$W^{\[l\]}​$ should be initialized randomly to break symmetry.
  * It is however okay to initialize the biases $b^{\[l\]}​$​ to zeros. Symmetry is still broken so long as ​$W^{\[l\]}​$ is initialized randomly.
* Initializing weights to very large random values does not work well.
* Hopefully initializing with small random values does better. The important question is: how small should be these random values be? Lets find out in the next part!
* Different initializations lead to different results
* He initialization works well for networks with ReLU activations.
* [Deep Learning Best Practices \(1\) — Weight Initialization](https://medium.com/usf-msds/deep-learning-best-practices-1-weight-initialization-14e5c0295b94)



## Deal with high variance

### Regularization

* Regularization will help you reduce overfitting.
* Regularization will drive your weights to lower values.
* L2 regularization and Dropout are two very effective regularization techniques.

#### L2-regularization

* What is L2-regularization actually doing? L2-regularization relies on the assumption that a model with small weights is simpler than a model with large weights. Thus, by penalizing the square values of the weights in the cost function you drive all the weights to smaller values. It becomes too costly for the cost to have large weights! This leads to a smoother model in which the output changes more slowly as the input changes.
* the implications of L2-regularization on:
  * The cost computation: A regularization term is added to the cost
  * The backpropagation function: There are extra terms in the gradients with respect to weight matrices
  * Weights end up smaller \("weight decay"\): Weights are pushed to smaller values.

### Dropout

* Dropout is a regularization technique.
* You only use dropout during training. Don't use dropout \(randomly eliminate nodes\) during test time.
* Apply dropout both during forward and backward propagation.
* During training time, divide each dropout layer by keep\_prob to keep the same expected value for the activations. For example, if keep\_prob is 0.5, then we will on average shut down half the nodes, so the output will be scaled by 0.5 since only the remaining half are contributing to the solution. Dividing by 0.5 is equivalent to multiplying by 2. Hence, the output now has the same expected value. You can check that this works even when keep\_prob is other values than 0.5.

## Gradient Checking

* Gradient checking verifies closeness between the gradients from backpropagation and the numerical approximation of the gradient \(computed using forward propagation\).
* Gradient checking is slow, so we don't run it in every iteration of training. You would usually run it only to make sure your code is correct, then turn it off and use backprop for the actual learning process.

## Mini-batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent \(SGD\)

* The difference between gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent is the number of examples you use to perform one update step.
* You have to tune a learning rate hyperparameter ​.
* With a well-turned mini-batch size, usually it outperforms either gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent \(particularly when the training set is large\).
* Shuffling and Partitioning are the two steps required to build mini-batches
* Powers of two are often chosen to be the mini-batch size, e.g., 16, 32, 64, 128.

## Gradient descent with Momentum

* Common values for ​ range from 0.8 to 0.999. If you don't feel inclined to tune this, ​$\beta = 0.9​$ is often a reasonable default.
* Momentum takes past gradients into account to smooth out the steps of gradient descent. It can be applied with batch gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent.
* You have to tune a momentum hyperparameter ​$\beta​$ and a learning rate ​$\alpha​$.
