* [Rhondene Wint on Twitter: "If you are unsure about the k number of clusters to choose during KMeans clustering, using the elbow method and silhouette analysis can be helpful. Choose k that minimizes distortion and maximizes mean silhouette score. @rasbt 's Python Machine Learning has excellent code. https://t.co/bLekWUA3w3"](https://mobile.twitter.com/R_Winty/status/1020091726285791232)
