### DBS banks on AWS; may shift 50% of workload to cloud

> One of the first use cases for AWS is in DBS’ Treasury and Markets \(T&M\) business. The bank will leverage AWS for the purpose of pricing and valuing financial instruments for risk management as this requires extensive computing power.
>
> AWS gives DBS the flexibility to rapidly scale the capacity of its computing grid up or down, without having to make provisions for permanent overcapacity. In the T&M case, it will allow the bank to have a quick and yet cost-effective way of handling short term surges in trading volumes such as those recently caused by Brexit.
>
> Over the last five years, DBS has made significant investments in strategic technology initiatives to weave banking into the everyday life of its customers so that they can spend more time on people or things that they care about. This includes initiating a comprehensive re-architecture of the bank’s technology as well as catalyzing a change in culture within the bank to one that is more “[FinTech](http://cw.com.hk/tag/fintech)-like” in nature.

### DBS TO INVEST SGD 250 MILLION TO GROW TREASURY & MARKETS BUSINESS IN ASIA

> **Move underscores T&M’s ambition to be leading Asian currency and fixed income house; follows exponential growth underpinned increasingly by customer flows**
>
> SINGAPORE, 23 September 2010 - DBS Bank, which has seen its Treasury and Markets \(T&M\) business grow exponentially over the last decade, today announced that it will be investing SGD 250 million to fuel the franchise’s next phase of expansion in order to become a leading Asian currency and fixed income house. This is in line with DBS’ strategic roadmap unveiled by CEO Piyush Gupta in February, in which one of the bank’s stated priorities is to build out its T&M capabilities across the region.
>
> The investment, to be made over the next five years, will enable the bank to ramp up its T&M capabilities in key Asia growth markets and to capture new opportunities especially in China and India. In particular, with the increasing internationalisation of the RMB, DBS is focused on leveraging its Greater China franchise to build a strong RMB business spanning foreign exchange, bonds, structured products and hedging solutions. DBS was one of the first few banks to offer RMB structured deposits in Hong Kong last month. In India, where DBS has the largest network of a Singapore bank, with 12 branches, the bank intends to set up a debt capital markets business to help Indian corporates access an alternative source of funding.   
>
> Plans are also underway to develop an enhanced FX online platform which will enable corporate customers, including SMEs across the region, to access foreign exchange rates for a comprehensive suite of Asian currencies 24/7 and on a real-time basis.  
>
> In Singapore, where DBS has one of the largest SGD trading books and is also the most active market maker for USD/SGD, SGD bonds, SGD rates, SGD money markets and SGD derivatives, the bank will continue to entrench its leadership position. For example, when DBS relocates its headquarters to the Marina Bay Financial Centre in 2013, the T&M team will operate out of a dealing room which is 40% larger than its current premises at Shenton Way.
>
> Said Andrew Ng, Head of DBS Treasury and Markets at DBS: “Asia is our backyard and we want to fully leverage our homeground advantage to establish a leading Asian currency and fixed income franchise. Over the last 10 years, T&M has enjoyed significant growth but with this being Asia’s decade, there are many opportunities to further partner our clients.  As we invest to enhance our regional T&M capabilities and scale up across Asia, by 2013, we expect more than 55% of T&M’s revenues to come from outside Singapore, up from 35% currently, and just over 10% in 2000.”
>
> In 2000, DBS signalled its commitment to being a serious player in the Asian T&M space with the establishment of the USD100 million DBS Asia Treasury Centre. This Centre supports the trading of foreign exchange, interest rates, equity, credit, fixed income instruments and the provision of investment and risk advisory services.
>
> Over the last decade, DBS’ T&M franchise has enjoyed tremendous success, with total revenues up by approximately five times, underpinned increasingly by customer flows.
>
> T&M is a specialist and a leading participant in Asian currencies. In Singapore, DBS today is one of the largest players in both SGD money markets as well as SGD related interest rate flows. In the SGD-bond market, year to date, DBS is the leader with a 39.1% market share, up from 21.3% in 2000. DBS is among the top three market makers in regional currency swaps.     
>
> Over the last 10 years, DBS T&M has also increased its geographic presence in Asia. In 2000, it had a presence in two markets – Singapore and Hong Kong. Today, this has expanded to seven markets, including China, Taiwan, India, Indonesia and South Korea.
>
> DBS is consistently recognised for the strength of its T&M franchise. The bank was named “Best FX Provider, Regional Winner \(South East Asia\)” in Global Finance’s Annual Survey for the last three years. Accolades won in 2010 include “Best Derivatives House in Singapore” by The Asset, “Best Debt House in Singapore” by Euromoney and “Best Foreign Exchange Bank in Singapore” by FinanceAsia. Last year, in Asiamoney’s Poll of Polls, DBS was voted as the “Best local/ domestic FX bank in Singapore since 1991”.

## **The Future of Auditing: Early Detection & Prevention of Significant Trading Irregularities by A\*STAR, Institute for Infocomm Research \(I2R\) and Group Audit, DBS Bank Ltd**

> In 2014, Institute for Infocomm Research \(I2R\) and DBS Bank entered into a partnership and set up a Joint Lab, a first of its kind between I²R and a bank in Asia, to develop new financial solutions by conducting research and also leveraging on existing IPs in data analytics and other leading edge technologies. In year 2015, we \(DAD @ I2R\) collaborated with DBS’ Group Audit team and other stakeholders \(for e.g. DBS’s Group Compliance and Treasury & Markets teams\) to implement a profiling, big data and text mining analytics tool called _**Trading PIITSStop**_ which will enable the Bank to:
>
> 1. Highlight trading behaviour \(e.g. outliers and anomalies\) and activities \(i.e. patterns\) that could lead to, or be related to potential trading irregularities; and
> 2. Detect potential trading and sales irregularities based on rule violations.
>
>  These timely warnings enable preventive measures to be undertaken before risks escalate i.e. spot abuse and irregularities before they can do harm.  Group Audit will be able to use the impactful outputs of the tool to perform continuous risk assessment and risk based audits.  In addition, the tool can benefit support units such as Compliance and Business Management Support teams in the area of monitoring and surveillance.
>
> From Nick Leeson to the London Whale, what’s evident about rogue traders is the catastrophic financial and reputational impacts of their actions on their banks. In this context, DBS-I2R Joint Lab has developed a Data Analytics driven solution for the Early Detection and Prevention of Trading Irregularities. This system now monitors all traders and their key activities at all times, significantly augmenting the Bank’s surveillance capabilities by detecting irregularities that would have been difficult to identify using traditional methods. Engineered in Singapore, this system has also attracted global interest and press coverage.

## Ronnie

> Ronnie is Managing Director and Head of Audit for Greater China of DBS Bank \(Hong Kong\) Limited. He joined DBS Bank \(Hong Kong\) in June 2004. Ronnie is responsible for the bank’s internal audit function for all business activities in Hong Kong, Mainland China and Taiwan. Ronnie is a seasoned auditor with 30 years of investment, commercial and retail banking experience and diversified product and market exposure in the US and Hong Kong. Prior to joining DBS, he was Director of Internal Audit Greater China and Deputy Head of Asia Pacific Audit for Credit Agricole group. He has also held senior internal audit positions with international financial institutions such as J.P. Morgan, Indosuez W.I. Carr Securities and Banque Indosuez. Ronnie started his auditing career with PricewaterhouseCoopers in 1983. Ronnie obtained an Honours Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Birmingham and a Master of Business Administration from Alliance Manchester Business School in the UK.

> **Knowledge is limitless **
>
> Currently the Head of Audit, Greater China and Managing Director of DBS, Ronnie Ip has long worked amongst the upper echelons of international investment banks, where he was put in charge of Asian operations. But he insisted on further studies – in 1999, he graduated from MBS’s MBA program, all the while motivating himself with Paul Arden’s book, It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want to Be, spurring himself onto greater heights.
>
> Ronnie explains that he chose MBS’s MBA program largely because of the school’s ranking and its reputation for stellar teaching. At that time he was often away on business – the flexible approach to lessons, therefore, was perfect for his schedule. ‘The curriculum was very forward-looking, with a slant towards global economics. It inspired me plenty, and also helped me gain much in terms of monetary and financial knowledge. At the same time, students were drawn from corporate levels of many different industries – when we converse, we often come up with different viewpoints, which was very invigorating for the intellect.’
>
> **Expanding professional circles, Putting lessons to practical use **
>
> Ronnie points out that lessons not only widened his professional circle, but were also great for practical use – they helped enhance his problem-solving skills. In particular, he had the best impression of the modules Organization Behavior and Human Resources Management, which focused on the teaching of soft skills. The reason for this was thus - before Ronnie joined DBS Hong Kong, he had never come into contact with retail banking operations. When he joined seven years ago, he was immediately put in charge of reorganizing and enhancing internal audit structure and efficiency, in order to align with the development of Greater China operations, and in order to raise team efficiency and co-operation. The management skills he gained from the MBA, therefore, came in extremely handy.
>
> At present, Ronnie’s internal audit team is supporting DBS’s 6000-strong team in the Greater China region. ‘As the head of department, the key is to retain and reward talent, thereby developing staff’s greatest potential. In this respect, the MBA program has inspired me no end. Also, when it comes to making operational decisions, it has also proven useful.’ Ronnie believes that learning environments can change a person’s attitude towards attaining success – such was the power of the MBA. At the same time the program has gathered together many executives from different industries - under their influence, all students were inspired to achieve no less than the very best in their career goals. Similarly, in the same spirit DBS is determined to become the best – to succeed as Asia’ No. 1 choice for retail banking.
