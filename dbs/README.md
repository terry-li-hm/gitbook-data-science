## **The Future of Auditing: Early Detection & Prevention of Significant Trading Irregularities by A\*STAR, Institute for Infocomm Research \(I2R\) and Group Audit, DBS Bank Ltd**

> In 2014, Institute for Infocomm Research \(I2R\) and DBS Bank entered into a partnership and set up a Joint Lab, a first of its kind between I²R and a bank in Asia, to develop new financial solutions by conducting research and also leveraging on existing IPs in data analytics and other leading edge technologies. In year 2015, we \(DAD @ I2R\) collaborated with DBS’ Group Audit team and other stakeholders \(for e.g. DBS’s Group Compliance and Treasury & Markets teams\) to implement a profiling, big data and text mining analytics tool called _**Trading PIITSStop**_ which will enable the Bank to:
>
> 1. Highlight trading behaviour \(e.g. outliers and anomalies\) and activities \(i.e. patterns\) that could lead to, or be related to potential trading irregularities; and
> 2. Detect potential trading and sales irregularities based on rule violations.
>
>  These timely warnings enable preventive measures to be undertaken before risks escalate i.e. spot abuse and irregularities before they can do harm.  Group Audit will be able to use the impactful outputs of the tool to perform continuous risk assessment and risk based audits.  In addition, the tool can benefit support units such as Compliance and Business Management Support teams in the area of monitoring and surveillance.

> From Nick Leeson to the London Whale, what’s evident about rogue traders is the catastrophic financial and reputational impacts of their actions on their banks. In this context, DBS-I2R Joint Lab has developed a Data Analytics driven solution for the Early Detection and Prevention of Trading Irregularities. This system now monitors all traders and their key activities at all times, significantly augmenting the Bank’s surveillance capabilities by detecting irregularities that would have been difficult to identify using traditional methods. Engineered in Singapore, this system has also attracted global interest and press coverage.

## Ronnie

> Ronnie is Managing Director and Head of Audit for Greater China of DBS Bank \(Hong Kong\) Limited. He joined DBS Bank \(Hong Kong\) in June 2004. Ronnie is responsible for the bank’s internal audit function for all business activities in Hong Kong, Mainland China and Taiwan. Ronnie is a seasoned auditor with 30 years of investment, commercial and retail banking experience and diversified product and market exposure in the US and Hong Kong. Prior to joining DBS, he was Director of Internal Audit Greater China and Deputy Head of Asia Pacific Audit for Credit Agricole group. He has also held senior internal audit positions with international financial institutions such as J.P. Morgan, Indosuez W.I. Carr Securities and Banque Indosuez. Ronnie started his auditing career with PricewaterhouseCoopers in 1983. Ronnie obtained an Honours Bachelor of Commerce degree from the University of Birmingham and a Master of Business Administration from Alliance Manchester Business School in the UK.

> **Knowledge is limitless **
>
> Currently the Head of Audit, Greater China and Managing Director of DBS, Ronnie Ip has long worked amongst the upper echelons of international investment banks, where he was put in charge of Asian operations. But he insisted on further studies – in 1999, he graduated from MBS’s MBA program, all the while motivating himself with Paul Arden’s book, It's Not How Good You Are, It's How Good You Want to Be, spurring himself onto greater heights.
>
> Ronnie explains that he chose MBS’s MBA program largely because of the school’s ranking and its reputation for stellar teaching. At that time he was often away on business – the flexible approach to lessons, therefore, was perfect for his schedule. ‘The curriculum was very forward-looking, with a slant towards global economics. It inspired me plenty, and also helped me gain much in terms of monetary and financial knowledge. At the same time, students were drawn from corporate levels of many different industries – when we converse, we often come up with different viewpoints, which was very invigorating for the intellect.’
>
> **Expanding professional circles, Putting lessons to practical use **
>
> Ronnie points out that lessons not only widened his professional circle, but were also great for practical use – they helped enhance his problem-solving skills. In particular, he had the best impression of the modules Organization Behavior and Human Resources Management, which focused on the teaching of soft skills. The reason for this was thus - before Ronnie joined DBS Hong Kong, he had never come into contact with retail banking operations. When he joined seven years ago, he was immediately put in charge of reorganizing and enhancing internal audit structure and efficiency, in order to align with the development of Greater China operations, and in order to raise team efficiency and co-operation. The management skills he gained from the MBA, therefore, came in extremely handy.
>
> At present, Ronnie’s internal audit team is supporting DBS’s 6000-strong team in the Greater China region. ‘As the head of department, the key is to retain and reward talent, thereby developing staff’s greatest potential. In this respect, the MBA program has inspired me no end. Also, when it comes to making operational decisions, it has also proven useful.’ Ronnie believes that learning environments can change a person’s attitude towards attaining success – such was the power of the MBA. At the same time the program has gathered together many executives from different industries - under their influence, all students were inspired to achieve no less than the very best in their career goals. Similarly, in the same spirit DBS is determined to become the best – to succeed as Asia’ No. 1 choice for retail banking.
