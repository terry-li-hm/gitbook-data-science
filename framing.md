> Humans are using computer systems in a ways that are unique and consistent with their own biology and physiology. The way humans click and type, the way humans use mouse and other input devices are pretty consistent with that person’s own behavior, habits, education level, and familiarity with a service or system.
>
> Habits and behaviors are very difficult to change and if we can identify legitimate users by their typical behavior patterns - we can detect anomalies on a totally new level. Same goes with fraudsters - ability to identify and quantify behavior patterns of cyber criminal will allow us to uncover and neutralize threats that may be undetectable by other means.
>
> The question is: can we recognize the user - or a class of users by some unique ways they use their input devices, such as mouse or keyboard? Enter Behavioral Biometrics: the field of study related to measure of uniquely identifying and measurable patterns in human activities.

Convert data into images and leverage CNN:

> To tackle this challenge we’ve decided to aggregate and convert mouse activity data points to color images. After all, a mouse always moves along a flat, 2D surface and it’s natural to convert these set of events into single image without losing much details. A single image can represent thousands of mouse activity data points.
>
> We’ve devised a specialized high contrast color encoding algorithm to represent direction, speed, and acceleration of mouse movements in a consistent way.
>
> This, for example, has helped us represent the difference in patterns between left and right-handed people. Mouse click actions were represented in larger color circles and mouse click+drag movements were drawn in thicker lines.
>
> This approach enabled us to encode not only trajectory lines but also to visually represent multidimensional dynamics of human behavior in all possible details ready to be analyzed and classified.

> Within Societe Generale, **we prefer to talk about machine learning rather than AI**. The bank employs many data scientists to train algorithms that deal with various business cases. Our SG Markets platform is an example where machine learning techniques have been used to create a recommendation engine. Based on the history of trades with Societe Generale, clients are advised of the most relevant research papers to read. We have also used machine learning to analyse thousands of contracts to detect missing clauses or recommend new clauses in legal documentation for our clients. A ChatParser application for fixed interest and equities trading desks captures information from various chat systems as well as email, translating them into requests for quotes. This saves precious seconds for traders and improves our response time to clients.
