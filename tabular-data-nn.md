# Tabular Data NN

## [\#1 Solution of Kaggle Competition Santander Customer Transaction Prediction \(binary classification\)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/discussion/89003#latest-535966)

> Fast.ai made my NN design very easy! I customized the tabular model for the architecture and implemented on the fly augmentation with a callback quite simply. I really recommend it to everyone â€¦ For the training of the neural network It also made things easy : I added batch norm and small dropouts almost everywhere and then the fit one cycle method with 15 epochs at 0.01 learning rate \(nothing fancy\) was enough to achieve those results!
