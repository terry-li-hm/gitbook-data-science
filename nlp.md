According to [bert-as-service](https://bert-as-service.readthedocs.io/en/latest/section/what-is-it.html):

> **BERT** is a NLP model [developed by Google](https://github.com/google-research/bert) for pre-training language representations. It leverages an enormous amount of plain text data publicly available on the web and is trained in an unsupervised manner. Pre-training a BERT model is a fairly expensive yet one-time procedure for each language. Fortunately, Google released several pre-trained models where [you can download from here](https://github.com/google-research/bert#pre-trained-models).

> **Sentence Encoding/Embedding** is a upstream task required in many NLP applications, e.g. sentiment analysis, text classification. The goal is to represent a variable length sentence into a fixed length vector, e.g. hello world to \[0.1, 0.3, 0.9\]. Each element of the vector should “encode” some semantics of the original sentence.
